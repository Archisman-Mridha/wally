/*!
  A write-ahead log (WAL for short, also known as a commit log) is an append-only auxiliary
  disk-resident structure used for crash and transaction recovery. The page cache allows buffering
  changes to page contents in memory. Until the cached contents are flushed back to disk, the only
  disk-resident copy preserving the operation history is stored in the WAL.

  The write-ahead log plays an important role in transaction processing. It is hard to overstate
  the importance of the WAL as it ensures that data makes it to the persistent storage and is
  available in case of a crash, as uncommitted data is replayed from the log and the pre-crash
  database state is fully restored.

  The write-ahead log is append-only and its written contents are immutable, so all writes to the
  log are sequential. Since the WAL is an immutable, append-only data structure, readers can safely
  access its contents up to the latest write threshold while the writer continues appending data to
  the log tail.

  The WAL consists of log records. Every record has a unique, monotonically increasing log sequence
  number (LSN). Usually, the LSN is represented by an internal counter or a timestamp. Since log
  records do not necessarily occupy an entire disk block, their contents are cached in the log
  buffer and are flushed on disk in a force operation. Forces happen as the log buffers fill up,
  and can be requested by the transaction manager or a page cache. All log records have to be
  flushed on disk in LSN order. Besides individual operation records, the WAL holds records
  indicating transaction completion. A transaction can’t be considered committed until the log is
  forced up to the LSN of its commit record.

  The WAL is usually coupled with a primary storage structure by the interface that allows trimming
  it whenever a checkpoint is reached. Logging is one of the most critical correctness aspects of
  the database, which is somewhat tricky to get right: even the slightest disagreements between log
  trimming and ensuring that the data has made it to the primary storage structure may cause data
  loss.

  Checkpoints are a way for a log to know that log records up to a certain mark are fully persisted
  and aren’t required anymore, which significantly reduces the amount of work required during the
  database startup. A process that forces all dirty pages to be flushed on disk is generally called
  a sync checkpoint, as it fully synchronizes the primary storage structure.

  NOTE : Flushing the entire contents on disk is rather impractical and would require pausing all
         running operations until the checkpoint is done, so most database systems implement fuzzy
         checkpoints. In this case, the last_checkpoint pointer stored in the log header contains
         the information about the last successful checkpoint. A fuzzy checkpoint begins with a
         special begin_checkpoint log record specifying its start, and ends with end_checkpoint log
         record, containing information about the dirty pages, and the contents of a transaction
         table. Until all the pages specified by this record are flushed, the checkpoint is
         considered to be incomplete. Pages are flushed asynchronously and, once this is done, the
         last_checkpoint record is updated with the LSN of the begin_checkpoint record and, in case
         of a crash, the recovery process will start from there
